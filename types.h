// Macro to determine the number of elements in an array at compile time.
// This does not work on pointers, as the compiler has no way of knowing
// what they point to.

// Adapted from Jorg Brown's implementation in the Chromium source.
// The following notes are from the Chromium documentation on the macro:
//
// ARRAYSIZE(arr) works by inspecting sizeof(arr) (the # of bytes in
// the array) and sizeof(*(arr)) (the # of bytes in one array
// element).  If the former is divisible by the latter, perhaps arr is
// indeed an array, in which case the division result is the # of
// elements in the array.  Otherwise, arr cannot possibly be an array,
// and we generate a compiler error to prevent the code from
// compiling.
//
// Since the size of bool is implementation-defined, we need to cast
// !(sizeof(a) & sizeof(*(a))) to size_t in order to ensure the final
// result has type size_t.
//
// This macro is not perfect as it wrongfully accepts certain
// pointers, namely where the pointer size is divisible by the pointee
// size.  Since all our code has to go through a 32-bit compiler,
// where a pointer is 4 bytes, this means all pointers to a type whose
// size is 3 or greater than 4 will be (righteously) rejected.
//
#define ARRAYSIZE(x) \
  ((sizeof(x) / sizeof(*(x))) / \
  (size_t)(!(sizeof(x) % sizeof(*(x)))))
